## question 1 Writing function

``` r
set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))
```

``` r
no_missing=function(x){
  if(is.numeric(x))   
    {x[is.na(x)]=mean(x,na.rm=TRUE)}
  else if (!is.numeric(x))
    {x[is.na(x)]="virginica"}
  
  x}
```

output with the function

``` r
output=map_dfr(iris_with_missing,no_missing)
```

## question 2 create tidy dataframe

``` r
allfiles=list.files(path="./data")%>%
  substr(1,6)
```

``` r
df= tibble(allfiles = list.files(path="./data"),
    path = str_c("./data/", allfiles))%>%
  mutate(obs_time = map(path, read_csv),)%>%
  unnest()%>%
  
  select(-path)%>%
  mutate(arm = substr(allfiles, 1, 3),
         arm = recode(arm, "con" = "Control", "exp" = "Experiment"),
    subject_id=substr(allfiles,5,6),
    subject_id=as.numeric(subject_id))%>%
  
  pivot_longer(week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "obs" )%>%
  
  mutate(week=substr(week, 6,7), week=as.numeric(week))%>%
  select(-allfiles)

## making spaghetti plot

``` r
df%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = obs, color=subject_id,group= subject_id)ï¼‰+
  geom_line() +facet_grid(. ~arm) +
   labs(title = "Observations on individual subjects",
    x = "week",
    y = "observations"
  ) 
```

![](p8105_hw5_yq2251_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

In the experiment group, as time goes, there is a visible increasing
trend in individual subjects. The control group is more stable without
much difference.

## question 3 regression model

``` r
sim_regression = function(n=30, sigma=50, beta0 = 2, beta1 = 0) {
  
  sim_data = tibble(
    xi1 = rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1),
    yi = beta0 + beta1 * xi1 + rnorm(n, 0, sigma)
  )
  
  ls_fit = lm(yi ~ xi1, data = sim_data)
  
  tibble(
    p_value = broom::tidy(ls_fit)$p.value[2],
    beta1_hat = broom::tidy(ls_fit)$estimate[2],
    alpha=0.05
  )
}
```

# Generate 10000 datasets

``` r
sim_results1 = 
  rerun(10000, sim_regression(30, 2, 0)) %>% 
  bind_rows()
```

# make a list for 6 beta1

``` r
beta1s=list("beta1_1"=1,"beta1_2"=2,"beta1_3"=3, "beta1_4"=4,"beta1_5"=5,"beta1_6"=6)
output = vector("list", 6)

for (i in 1:6) {
  output[[i]] = rerun(10000, sim_regression(beta1s[[i]])) %>% 
    bind_rows
}
```

``` r
sim_results2 = 
  tibble(beta1 = c(1,2,3,4,5,6)) %>% 
  mutate(
    output_lists = map(.x = beta1, ~rerun(10000, sim_regression(beta1 = .x))),
    estimate_dfs = map(output_lists, bind_rows)) %>% 
  select(-output_lists) %>% 
  unnest(estimate_dfs)
```

# Effect size and power

``` r
sim_results2%>%
  filter(p_value<0.05)%>%
  group_by(beta1)%>%
  summarise(num_power=n())%>%
  mutate(power_test=num_power/10000)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = beta1, y = power_test, color=beta1)) + 
  geom_point()+geom_line()+
  labs(
    title = "Association between Effect Size and Power",
    x = "Effect Size",
    y = "Power"
  ) 
```

This graphs shows the association between effect size and power. We can
see from the graph that as effect size increases, power also increases.

# estimated beta1 and true beta1

``` r

  mutate(
    average_beta1=mean(beta1_hat)
    ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = beta1, y = average_beta1, color=beta1)) + 
  geom_point()+geom_line()+
  labs(
    title = "Association between Average estimate of beta1 hat and true beta1",
    x = "True beta1",
    y = "Average estimate of beta1 hat"
  )
```

![](p8105_hw5_yq2251_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
sim_results2%>%
  group_by(beta1)%>%
  filter(p_value<0.05)%>%
  mutate(
    avg_beta1_reject=mean(beta1_hat)
    ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = beta1, y = avg_beta1_reject, color=beta1)) + 
  geom_point()+geom_line()+
  labs(
    title = "Association between average estimate of beta1 (null rejected) & true beta1",
    x = "True beta1",
    y = "Average estimate of beta1 hat (null rejected)"
  )
```

![](p8105_hw5_yq2251_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)<!-- -->

When the null is rejected, estimate of beta1 is not the same as true
value of beta1. The average estimated beta1 is bigger than true beta1.
When the null hypothesis is accepted, beta1 is 0. Since only samples
with rejected null included (those with alpha less than 0.05), the
beta1s with values around 0 are not included in data analysis. Thus the
average of the estimated beta1s would be bigger without beta1s =0.
